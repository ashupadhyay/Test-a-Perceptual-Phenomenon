# Test-a-Perceptual-Phenomenon

## Project Overview
In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the **Stroop Effect**. I learnt a little bit about the experiment, created a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then went through the task myself. I then looked at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and computed some statistics describing the results. Finally, the interpretation of my results were given in terms of the hypotheses.

## Why this Project?
Statistics is a major component of data analysis, it allows you to investigate data and make inferences based on your observations. A foundation in statistics also allows you to be a consumer of analyses that others perform, and allows you to relate to the conclusions others have drawn from their investigations.

## What will I Learn?
This project will review the basic concepts of statistics, including:

- How to identify components of an experiment
- How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
- How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results

## Why is this Important to my Career?
This project is focused on statistics, including designing an experiment and testing a hypothesis. Using statistics to draw valid conclusions about data is an important part of a data analyst's work. When you see a company release a new feature, what do you think went into the decisionmaking? Typically, a business has a goal they want to achieve - for Udacity, it may mean increased enrollments. Udacity has spent a long time user testing and A/B testing to make sure trials of potential products indicate they'd get the outcome they wanted.
